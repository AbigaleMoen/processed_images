## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ m101-101I.fit through m101-103I.fit, have dust donuts and uneven background lighting
+ sa104-104I.fit -- again dust donuts and uneven background lighting
+ `sa104-088R.fit` -- Virtually no stars...

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

The image `sa104-088R.fit` is missing both object name and WCS because very few stars are visible. The image is essentially useless.


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.

Added astrometry to some images, re-ran the summary of the directory.
