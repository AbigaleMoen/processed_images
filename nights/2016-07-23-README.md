## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `calibration-010D60.fit` -- Big cosmic ray.
+ `calibration-009I.fit` -- Another nice cosmic ray.
+ `OutOfFocusExample(3020).fit` -- A (deliberately) out-of-focus image to demonstrate what an out-of-focus image looks like.


## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

These two images have no object information because they were taken with the intent of illustrating what an in focus/out of focus field of stars looks likt:

+ `InFocusExample(2882).fit` -- nStar field in focus.
+ `OutOfFocusExample(3020).fit` -- Stars out of focus.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The object `IC4665` had to be added to most of the light images.
