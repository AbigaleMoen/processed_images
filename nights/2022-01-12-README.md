## Raw image gallery: http://physics.mnstate.edu/feder_gallery/2022-01-12

## Notes

+ These images were taken with the manufacturer's power supply. 
+ Set point was `-30C` BUT CHANGED TO `-27C` because of insufficient air flow.


## Unusual images?

+ Horizontal banding in many bias images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.
