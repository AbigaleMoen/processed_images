## Unusual images?

Several images look unusual; there were light clouds during the night, which show up in some of the image. In addition, some of darks have an after-image of a star in them.

Details:

+ Darks from `calibration-0001Dark90.fit` to `calibration-0004Dark90.fit` have a star after-image in them.
+ These images clearly have clouds:

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

All of the right ascencions in the images were wrong initially. Never had that happen before, not 
sure what the cause was.
