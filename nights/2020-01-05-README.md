## Unusual images?
Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ ey-uma-S001-R001-C002-rp.fit - Centering is off slightly, 2nd image in sequence

## Many of the M1 images have varying clarity - in some M1 is super faded out, some have it super strong. It seems to be a cycle, similar to how it seems that every R001 image for M1 has the target at the far left side of the image instead of centered. There is also periodic "flare ups" of dust etc on images to be removed via flat correcting, so I didn't mention those specifically.

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ Follow up to check if object names are missing - the Issues page says that's a problem, but it appears that the images have object names.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.
