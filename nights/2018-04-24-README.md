## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? 

No; some clouds in some of the EY UMa images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

No object for most of the images because most are of a random star field.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Re-ran astrometry without using pyfits (which will soon be the new default).
