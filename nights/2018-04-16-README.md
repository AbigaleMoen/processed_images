## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Very faint satellite in `ey-uma-0003r.fit`
+ Nice cosmic rays in `calibration-0001D90.fit` and `calibration-0006D30.fit`
+ Odd blob in center of all EY UMa images (may be an after-image?)

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

NOTE: All of the images in the tracking subdirectory are small cutouts of guide star.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing special once new objects were added to the list.
