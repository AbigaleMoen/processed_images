## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Many bias and dark images have horizontal banding/static in them.
+ Falts now have a sort of line pattern to them -- maybe from cleaning?
+ `Dark-S001-R001-C001-NoFilt_dupe-1.fit` -- Do not use, was taken around sunrise
+ `TIC_81247877.01-S001-R097-C001-rp.fit` -- banding
+ `TIC_81247877.01-S001-R100-C001-rp.fit` -- satellite

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing, happily!
