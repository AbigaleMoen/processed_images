## Unusual images?


+ `Dark-S001-R001-C001-NoFilt_dupe-1.fit` -- Small grey circles scattered throughout the image. It looks like they are only apparent on the dupe versions of the darks.
+ `Dark-S001-R001-C001-NoFilt_dupe-2.fit` -- Not a very dark, dark.
+ `Dark-S001-R001-C002-NoFilt_dupe-2.fit` -- Another bright dark on a dupe-2.
+ `AutoFlat-PANoRot-ip-Bin1-001.fit` -- Every other flat starting with this one has a ton of small dots all over the image.
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R003-C001-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- Very strange. Almost looks like the stars are duplicated and shifted down?
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R004-C001-rp.fit` -- Whole image shifted down, and satellite through the image. 
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R005-C001-rp.fit` -- Satellite.

*Images start getting progressively blurrier at about halfway through the night. The rp images near the end of the night are overly saturated.*

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I made no changes.
