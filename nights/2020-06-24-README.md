**You may want to not use the first few darks because of light leak.** 

It was also **partly cloudy that night** so **check that the combined flat looks good.** If your science results are off then takea look at using flats from another night.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Had to add the object manually but was otherwise fine.
