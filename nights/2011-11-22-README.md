## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All of the calibration are strange. The biases have horizontal stripes across them. Many of the flats look like they are completely saturated. THere are only 30 second dark (but they look fine!).

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

These two images do NOT appear to be of V0556 Cas:

+ `V0556_Cas-011I.fit`
+ `V0556_Cas-011R.fit`

No idea what, if anything significant, these are images of.

This image does not have WCS and I was unable to add it:

+ `SA_92-570B.fit`

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing done
