## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Horizontal banding in most of the bias images.
+ `Bias-S001-R001-C020-NoFilt.fit` -- nice cosmic ray!
+ `M51-S001-R004-C001-B.fit` -- horizontal banding
+ `M51-S001-R004-C001-rp.fit` -- horizontal banding
+ `M51-S001-R005-C001-rp.fit` -- satellite (?); track is almost vertical
+ `M51-S001-R010-C001-B.fit` -- satellite
+ `M51-S001-R013-C001-gp.fit` -- satellite; another almost vertical one
+ `M51-S001-R014-C001-gp.fit` -- faint satellite
+ `M81-S001-R014-C001-gp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C011-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ EY UMa 1-12 probably unusable because of sky background 
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C013-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- bad horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C015-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C020-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C041-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C045-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- bad horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C050-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- bad horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C053-rp.fit` -- satellite (almost horizontal?!)
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C056-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- bad horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C057-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- bad horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C058-rp.fit` -- satellite

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The images of M81 have file names that start `M95`, which was wildly confusing, so M95 files were renamed in processing to start M81, including in the gallery. The raw files still have the name `M95` in them.
