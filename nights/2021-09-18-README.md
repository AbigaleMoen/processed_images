## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `M57-S001-R003-C001-gp.fit` -- Bad horizontal banding
+ `NGC-6946-S001-R002-C001-B.fit ` -- faint satellite

**ALl images have fairly bright background because of moon.**
