## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ EY_Uma-182R.fit -- satellite track, a decent amount of the ey uma pics had some just general streaking across them..however not sure how bad it actually is. The M101 pictures looked good.
+ EY-Uma data has dark bands through a lot of the images
+ EY-Uma-278R.fit through EY-Uma-330R.fit -- dust appears on images
+ SA98 data has dark horizontal bands 



Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.
