## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ **All bias images** have fairly extensive horizontal banding
+ **Dawn and dusk flats** look quite a bit different
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C001-rp.fit` -- offset from the rest of the Kelt-16 images
+ `m33-S001-R001-C001-rp.fit` -- offset from the rest of the M33 images
+ `m33-S001-R014-C001-ip.fit` -- short satellite track

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true (check the issue for this night for this information):

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing!
