## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `TIC_470127886.01-S001-R001-C002-rp.fit` -- top half of the image is very bright
+ `TIC_470127886.01-S003-R001-C001-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `TIC_470127886.01-S003-R001-C002-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `TIC_470127886.01-S001-R002-C001-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- satellite
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C001-ip.fit` -- satellite
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R004-C001-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- satellite
+ `kelt-16-b-S003-R001-C001-ip.fit` -- satellite on right side

Notes: Many white & black blotches in the bias images. 
       There's also smaller black marks that slowly receede as exposure increases.
       Center of Kelt-16 images seems to be shifting very slightly from image to image, might just be my eyes.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)




## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing needed to be fixed.
