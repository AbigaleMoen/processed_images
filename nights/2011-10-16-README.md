## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ wasp-10-b-101r.fit -- satellite marks
+ twi-flat-005box_I.fit -- This looks like flat, not a light image
+ twi-flat-004box_I.fit -- Also looks like a flat
+ twi-flat-003box_I.fit -- Also looks like a flat
+ twi-flat-002box_I.fit  -- Also looks like a flat
+ twi-flat-001box_I.fit  -- Also looks like a flat
+ m101-033v.fit -- satellite marks


Images above that were actually flats have been tagged as `IMAGETYP=FLAT`.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Updated image type for the incorrectly classified images.

Tried a number of semi-manual ways of improving the astrometry situation before hitting on using a SExtractor configuration matched to our images, and also found that it was necessary to pull in some of the old astrometry.net index files. The last step was to manually add SA110 as the object to several of the images.
