## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All of the flats have dark "blobs" on them. Presumably all of the images have them, including the science images.
+ `another-crazy-object-003B.fit` -- this looks more like a flat than a science image.
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C003-rp.fit ` -- satellite track
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C029-rp.fit` -- satellite track
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C037-rp.fit` -- satellite track
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C058-rp.fit` -- satellite track
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C069-rp.fit` -- satellite track
+ `kelt-16-b-S001-R001-C086-rp.fit` -- satellite track

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing needed
