## Unusual images?

### NOTE ONE OF THE TWO COVERS ON THE TELESCOPE WAS CLOSED

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `Foo-S001-R001-C001-ip.fit` and `Foo-S001-R001-C001-ip_dupe-1.fit` -- not sure what this is an image of -- these were daylight test images
+ `Bias-S001-R001-C001-NoFilt_dupe-1.fit` -- flats are half moons instead of donuts and ignore the duplicate baises.
+ `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R002-C001-ip.fit` and `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R003-C001-ip.fit` and `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R012-C001-ip.fit` --  Looks like rain drops instead of stars just a heads up.
+ `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R007-C001-ip.fit` and `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R021-C001-ip.fit` and `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R030-C001-ip.fit`-- satellite
+ `TIC_272519426.01-S001-R033-C001-ip.fit` and `kelt-16-S001-R002-C001-ip.fit`-- satellite
+ `kelt-16-S001-R021-C001-B.fit1 and `kelt-16-S001-R023-C001-B.fit` and `kelt-16-S001-R027-C001-B.fit `-- might be double stars form the telescope moving during the picture.
Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.
