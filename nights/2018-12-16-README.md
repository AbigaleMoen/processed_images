## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All of the very short exposure flats (under, say, 2 seconds) have a "starfish" pattern in them due to the shutter.
+ `AutoFlat-PANoRot-r-Bin1-001.fit` -- Almost completely saturated.
+ Big difference b tw morning and evening flats in general.
+ **All EY UMa images** -- Badly out of focus (donuts).
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C044-r.fit` -- satellite track that might be useful to check for doubling.
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C002-r.fit` -- pretty cloudy
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C009-r.fit` -- cloudy *and* a satellite track
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C015-r.fit` -- another pretty cloudy one
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C101-r.fit` -- partial satellite track
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C117-r.fit` -- partial satellite track
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C141-r.fit` -- clouding up a bit
+ `kelt-1-S001-R001-C144-r.fit` -- much clouds
+ `m34-S001-R002-C001-g.fit` -- nice satellite track
+ `m34-S001-R008-C001-r.fit` -- getting cloudy
+ `m34-S001-R009-C001-r.fit` -- particularly bad clouds
+ `m67-S001-R012-C001-B.fit` through `m67-S001-R030-C001-r.fit` -- bad focus which increasingly gets worse.
+ Cloudy:
  + `wirtanen-S001-R005-C001-r.fit`
  + `wirtanen-S001-R006-C001-g.fit` and so on through...
  + `wirtanen-S001-R007-C001-r.fit`

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

No WCS, looks like there were clouds:

+ `wirtanen-S001-R006-C001-B.fts`
+ `wirtanen-S001-R006-C001-g.fts`
+ `wirtanen-S001-R007-C001-B.fts`
+ `wirtanen-S001-R007-C001-g.fts` 

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Had to add the object name manually for the comet `46P/Wirtanen`.
