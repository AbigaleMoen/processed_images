## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `M57-S001-R004-C001-gp.fit` -- Satellite track (but doesn't cut through M57)

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [X] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [X] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [X] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

However, we **are** missing the following:
- [x] We have no biases for this evening (2019-06-01 may be alterate source for biases)
- [x] We have no darks for this evening (need at least 180s darks, 2019-06-01 has 90s darks)
- [x] Missing flats for the B filter (2016-06-01 has B flats)

**Observer's Note:** On this night, the darks and biases were planned as were additional flats, but the dome started spinning and so ACP never started those exposures.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I copied the biases, darks, and B flats from 2019-06-01 into this directory.  Note these are 90s darks only, so the 180s exposures will still probably not be correctly handled.
