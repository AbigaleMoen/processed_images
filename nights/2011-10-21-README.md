## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `hat-p-32-b-485i.fit` -- nice satellite track.

These images are essentially all static:

+ `sa110-408b.fit`
+ `sa110-408i.fit`
+ `sa110-408r.fit`
+ `sa110-408v.fit`
+ `sa110-409b.fit`
+ `sa113-612i.fit` 
+ `sa113-612r.fit`
+ `sa113-612v.fit`

These images have only a few stars:

+ `sa110-363b.fit
+ `sa110-363v.fit`
+ `sa110-364b.fit`
+ `sa110-364v.fit`
+ `sa110-365b.fit`
+ `sa110-365v.fit`
+ `sa110-366b.fit`
+ `sa110-367b.fit`
+ `sa110-368b.fit`

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ Images described as static or few stars above are missing WCS. 
+ The SA110 images in the few/no stars section above are also missing object names. Iw was not added because the image quality is so low.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The images whose name starts with `neo` are images of the asteroid `2011 UW63`. The object name `2011UW63` has been added to those images.

## THERE ARE ONLY `R` and `I` FLATS FOR THIS NIGHT.
