## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `TIC_147890655.01-S001-R032-C001-gp.fit` -- blurry rotation
+ `TIC_147890655.01-S001-R032-C001-ip.fit ` -- blurry rotation
+ `fTIC_147890655.01-S001-R035-C001-gp.fit` -- satellite upper left
+ `TIC_147890655.01-S001-R011-C001-gp.fit`  -- satelite middle of immage

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

These wont get astrometry because of rotation in the images/blurring:

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I did not change anything.
