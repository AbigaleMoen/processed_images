## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ ee-lyn-514R.fit -- Some kind of markings on the image
+ ee-lyn-528R.fit -- satellite tracks
+ ee-lyn-533R.fit -- a dark band across the bottom..not sure what it is from
+ ee-lyn-564R.fit -- dark band on this one as well
+ m101-996R.fit -- some streaking across the image


Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

These two images are missing WCS because there are too few stars to get a good match with astrometry.net:

+ `sa92-336B.fit`
+ `sa92-337B.fit`

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Reran astrometry with custom SExtractor configuration.
