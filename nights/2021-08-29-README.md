## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

All images had the correct information.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

No changes required.
