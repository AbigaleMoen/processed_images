## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ m101-006v.fit -- satellite track mark in the upper right corner
+ m101-009i.fit -- Weird mark in upper left area.. not really sure what to describe it as
+ m101-032i.fit -- satellite track mark


## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Re-ran astrometry on some images, manually added object name SA110 to the standard star field images.
