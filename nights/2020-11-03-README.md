## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

**MOST CALIBRATION IMAGES ARE MISSING!** THere are 5 biases, and the usual number of flats but no darks. Recommend using calibration frames from 2020-11-02 instead.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing
