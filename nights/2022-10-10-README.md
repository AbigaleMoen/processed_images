## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All `TIC_337025682` are useless -- clouds or something interfering so lots of bright light
+ `TIC_467265105.01-S001-R013-C001-ip.fit` -- Satellite
+ `TIC_467265105.01-S001-R017-C001-ip.fit` -- Satellite
+ `TIC_467265105.01-S001-R063-C001-ip.fit` -- really nice kinked cosmic ray track

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Added object name after updating list.
