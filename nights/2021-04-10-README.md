Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ `TIC_142276270.01-S001-R002-C050-rp.fit` to `TIC_142276270.01-S001-R002-C057-rp.fit` -- completely saturated, so no WCS

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Added object name to the new TIC object, moved some of the images into a "bad" folder (the bad dark and the saturated images).
