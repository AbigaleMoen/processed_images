## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All the dark images are a little "wavy" because of light leakage while the darks were being taken.
+ `hat-p-23-075R.fit` and `hat-p-23-076R.fit` have a satellite track.
+ `hat-p-23-084R.fit` has a satellite.
+ `hat-p-23-084R.fit` through `hat-p-23-103R.fit` have lots of clouds.
+ `sa113-001R.fit` and `sa113-002R.fit` have clouds.
+ `v0440-lac-017R.fit` has a satellite.
+ `v0440-lac-110R.fit` and later are all pretty cloudy.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing special.
