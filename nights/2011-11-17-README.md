## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `m101-459B.fit` -- Nice cosmic ray in here.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing, this was pretty straightforward.
