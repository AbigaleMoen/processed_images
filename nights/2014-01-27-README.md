## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All 60 and 90 second darks have "afterimages" of stars in them.
+ Cosmic rays in several dark images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ `sa104-008B.fit` -- no WCS, few stars visible.
+ `sa104-009B.fit` -- no WCS, few stars visible.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing done; tried to manually (as in interactively at the command line) add WCS but that failed.
